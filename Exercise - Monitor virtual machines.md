## Skill 3: Create alerts

In this task, you will create two alert rules.

1. In the **Monitor** section, select **Alerts**.
    
    > [Virtual machine alerts](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/vm/monitor-virtual-machine-alerts) are automated notifications in Azure Monitor that provide insights into the status of Azure resource. There are no preconfigured alert rules for virtual machines, but there is a set of recommended alert rules you can enable. Or you can just create your own.
    
2. Select **Create +** and select **Alert rule**.
    

### Create an alert rule based on CPU percentage usage

1. In the **Signal name** drop-down select **Percentage CPU**.
    
2. You want to be alerted when the CPU threshold is over 90%. So, change the **Threshold value** to `90`.
    
    > Alerts can be based on metrics. Metrics are numerical values that are automatically collected at regular intervals and describe some aspect of a resource. For example, this metric would tell you the processor utilization of a virtual machine.
    
3. You also need to adjust the **When to evaluate** settings. It is important to be reasonable about how often the alert is checked.
    
    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Loopback period|`1 hour`|
    |Check every|`1 hour`|
    
4. Select **Next: Actions>** tab, **Use action groups**, then choose the **Help Desk** action group and click **Select**.
    
5. Move to the **Details** tab, complete the required information.
    
    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Severity|`2 - Warning`|
    |Alert rule name|`VM2CPUAlert`|
    
6. Select **Review + create**, then select **Create**.
    

### Create an alert based on log activity

1. Select **Create +** and select **Alert rule**.
    
2. On the **Condition** tab select **See all signals**.
    
3. Search for and select **Create or update virtual machine (Virtual Machines)**. **Apply** your changes.
    
    > This alert is based on information from a log search. Logs are stored in a [Log Analytics workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview).
    
4. In the **Alert logic** area (scroll down) review the **Event level** selections. Leave the default of **All selected**.
    
5. Review the **Status** drop-down selections. Leave the default of **All selected**.
    
6. On the **Actions** tab, **Use action groups**, then choose the **Help Desk** action group and click **Select**.
    
7. Move to the **Actions** tab, **Select action groups**, then choose the **Help Desk** action group and click **Select**.
    
    > This exercise uses an action group, but an alert doesn’t require an action group.
    
8. Move to the **Details** tab and enter the following values for each setting.
    
    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Alert rule name|`VM2changed`|
    |Alert rule description|`VM2 was updated or deleted.`|

- Can you create a virtual machine alert based on metrics?
- Can you create a virtual machine alert based on log activity?
- Can you assign an action group to an alert?

## Skill 4: Trigger an alert by resizing the virtual machine

In this task, you will review performance data and resize a virtual machine.

1. Continue working with your virtual machine.
    
2. In the **Monitoring** section select the **Metrics** blade. Take a few minutes to explore.
    - You can create a variety of different charts, like a **Line chart**.
    - You can **Scope** the chart to include one or more virtual machines.
    - You can select the **Metrics** to include in the chart.
    - You can create a **New alert rule** from your data.
    - You can **Save to the dashboard**.
3. In the **Monitoring** section select the **Logs** blade. If necessary, **close** the **Welcome to Log Analytics** page. Take a few minutes to explore.
    
    - In the **Topic** drop-down select **Resource type** and then **Virtual machines**.
    - Notice there are a large number of built-in queries that might be of interest. For example, the **Count heartbeats** or **Virtual Machine available memory**.
    - Take time to explore and **Run** any queries of interest.
    - Depending on the virtual machine activity, there may not be a lot of events.
4. Based on your monitoring review you learn the CPU percentage is close to being maxed out. You decide to increase the number of CPUs.
    
    > You can scale the VM up or down by [changing the VM size](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/resize-vm?tabs=portal). In some cases, you must deallocate the VM first.
    
5. In the **Availability + scale** blade, select **Size**.
    
6. Set the virtual machine size to **D2as_v4** size, and click **Resize**. If prompted, confirm the change.
    
    > If the VM size is not available, choose another larger VM. Resizing is also known as vertical scaling, up or down.
